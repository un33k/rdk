# rdk
RDK is short for React Component Dev Kit. Its a set of low-level tools that implement
common interactions found in component libraries. The tooling abstracts the visual
presentation so the tools can be used with any visual presentation.

The library includes:

- Overlay - Provides a way to open floating panels on the screen
- Portal - Provides a flexible system for rendering dynamic content into an application
- Position - Provides a flexible system for placing panels related to other elements
- ExitListener - Provides a easy way to listen for exit events such as clicks and escape keypress.
